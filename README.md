# 4 Pillars of OOP (contd..)
- Banking System

# __repr__ method
- Special method like __init__, which is used to define a string representation for an object.
- Particularly used for debugging and development because it can give detailed info about an object.

# Composition of OOP
- Sedign principle where a class is composed of one or more objects from other classes.
- It is an alternative to Inheritance and is often more flexible and modular.
- Avoids Inheritance's pitfall: Changes in base class can unintentionally affect the derived class, which may break their functionality.
- Composition does not directly affect the composed class, as the class inherits with compent classes through well-defined interfaces.
